abstract="Symbolic Model Checking [3], [14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. BDDs [2] have traditionally been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like St{\aa}lmarck's Method [16] or the Davis {\&} Putnam Procedure [7], can replace BDDs. This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.",

The goal is to reflect the current state of the art in software verification in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The major achievement of the 6                                                                                  {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}text {\{}th{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                   edition of SV-COMP is that the verification results were validated in most categories. The verifiers have to produce verification witnesses, which contain hints that a validator can later use to reproduce the verification result. The answer of a verifier counts only if the validator confirms the verification result. SV-COMP uses two independent, publicly available witness validators. For 2017, a new category structure was introduced that now orders the verification tasks according to the property to verify on the top level, and by the type of programs (e.g., which kind of data types are used) on a second level. The categories Overflows and Termination were heavily extended, and the category SoftwareSystems now contains also verification tasks from the software system BusyBox. The competition used 8 908 verification tasks that each consisted of a C program and a property (reachability, memory safety, termination). SV-COMP 2017 had 32 participating verification systems from 12 countries.",

abstract="Despite 20+ years of research on processor verification, it remains hard to use formal verification techniques in commercial processor development. There are two significant factors: scaling issues and return on investment. The scaling issues include the size of modern processor specifications, the size/complexity of processor designs, the size of design/verification teams and the (non)availability of enough formal verification experts. The return on investment issues include the need to start catching bugs early in development, the need to continue catching bugs throughout development, and the need to be able to reuse verification IP, tools and techniques across a wide range of design styles.",
