\section{Conclusions and Prospects}\label{sec:concl}

Demand for more scalable verification tools is ever growing.  In this paper,
we present an alternative solution for verifying hardware, at the heart of
which is a verifier for software.  To this end, we present a technique to 
synthesize a software netlist from Verilog RTL.  We then use state-of-the-art
software verification tools to verify these software netlist models.  Our 
experimental results present a detailed comparison of various unbounded 
verification algorithms at bit-level, word-level and software level.  Our proposed 
hardware verification flow enables seamless adoption of any advances in software 
verification technology to RTL verification.  We observe that bit-level operations 
are less prevelant in conventional software and hence software analyzers are not 
optimized to reason about bit manipulating software programs.  However, most software 
tools are able to successfully verify RTL circuits and the performance of these tools 
are within an order of magnitude compared to bit-level hardware tools.  Existing abstract 
domains used in abstraction based software tools are insufficient for precise reasoning 
of software netlist models.  This can be addressed by either developing heuristics 
more adapted to the code generated by v2c, or manually annotating the generated code 
to improve the precision of the analysis. In this paper, we follow the later approach 
to obtain the desired results.
