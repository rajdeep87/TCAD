\section{Contribution}~\label{contribution}
We make the following technical contributions in this paper.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present formal verification of RTL designs in software language 
using native software analyzers.  To this end, we present an automatic 
translation of hardware circuits described in Verilog RTL into software 
program in C language using our tool \emph{v2c}.  We call the resulting 
software program {\em software netlist}.  
%We distribute our benchmark suite containing Verilog 
%RTL designs and the equivalent C models at~\footnote{http://www.cprover.org/hardware/v2c/}. 

\item We compare formal verification of RTL designs 
using bit-level netlist and software netlist.  
%Our tool supports RTL descriptions in 1364-2005 SystemVerilog standards. 
To this end, we emperically evaluate various unbounded SAT/SMT based verification techniques, 
such as $K$-induction, Interpolation, IC3/PDR and classical abstraction-based 
techniques such as Abstract Interpretation for safety verification of RTL designs.  
%    
In particular, we compare the performance of verification 
tools that employ these techniques from Hardware Model Checking Competition 
(HWMCC)~\footnote{http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc15/} against software verifiers from Software 
Verification Competition (SV-COMP)~\footnote{https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2017/}.

\Omit {
\item Our tool also supports BDD-based model checking using a custom BDD 
package called \textsc{Mini-BDD}. To this end, we present a comparison of 
SAT/SMT based verification with the BDD-based model checker.  Our benchmarks 
are drawn from safety checking track in Hardware Model Checking Competition 
(HWMCC)~\footnote{http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc15/} and several other open-source 
repositories.
