\section{Contribution}~\label{contribution}
We make the following technical contributions in this paper.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a formal verification flow for RTL designs using state-of-the-art 
software verifiers.  To this end, we present an automatic translation of 
hardware circuits described in Verilog RTL into a software representation 
in ANSI-C using our tool \textsc{v2c}.  We call the resulting software model 
as {\em software netlist}.  We distribute our benchmark suite containing Verilog 
RTL designs and the equivalent C models at~\footnote{http://www.cprover.org/hardware/v2c/}. 

\item We present an extensive experimental evaluation that compares formal 
verification of RTL designs using different netlist representations at 
-- 1) bit-level, 2) word-level and 3) software-level.  Our tool supports 
RTL descriptions in 1364-2005 SystemVerilog standards. 

\item We emperically evaluate various unbounded SAT/SMT based verification techniques, 
such as $K$-induction, Interpolation, IC3/PDR, Abstract Interpretation for safety 
verification of RTL designs.  To this end, we compare the performance of verification 
tools that employ these techniques from Hardware Model Checking Competition 
(HWMCC)~\footnote{http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc15/} against software verifiers from Software 
Verification Competition (SV-COMP)~\footnote{https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2017/}.

\Omit {
\item Our tool also supports BDD-based model checking using a custom BDD 
package called \textsc{Mini-BDD}. To this end, we present a comparison of 
SAT/SMT based verification with the BDD-based model checker.  Our benchmarks 
are drawn from safety checking track in Hardware Model Checking Competition 
(HWMCC)~\footnote{http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc15/} and several other open-source 
repositories.
