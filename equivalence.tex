\section{Equivalence of RTL and Software Netlist}
%
The consistency between two designs can be established in several ways. 
For example, few common notion of consistency criteria are \emph{behavioral}, 
\emph{cycle-accurate}, \emph{non-cycle accurate} or \emph{functional}
consistency.  The consistency between a reference model and an implementation
model is performed through systematic equivalence checking~\cite{}.  Equivalence
checking between a timed and untimed model is a hard
problem~\cite{}.  Sequential equivalence checking techniques are used to check 
the equivalence between an asynchronous event driven semantics of C and synchronous 
clock driven semantics of Verilog~\cite{}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CYCLE ACCURATE EQUIVALENCE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Two designs are said to be \emph{cycle-accurate-equivalent}~\cite{cycle} \rmcmt{more
reference} if they produce the same output using the same number of clock cycles.   

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NON-CYCLE ACCURATE EQUIVALENCE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Whereas, two designs are \emph{not cycle-accurate-equivalent}~\cite{cycle} if they require 
different cycles to perform the same computation. For example, consider two circuits
implementing the Euclid's algorithm to compute Greatest Common Divisor (GCD),
where Circuit A uses two subtractors and Circuit B uses one subtractor.  In this
case, Circuit B requires more cycle than Circuit A to compute the GCD. Thus,
they are functional-equivalent but not cycle-accurate-equivalent. However,
Circuit A and Circuit B can be made cycle-accurate-equivalent by making Circuit
A to stutter for few cycles until Circuit B finishes its slower operation.  This
may require some additional logic in Circuit A to determine the condition for 
stuttering.  


In this paper, we consider an equivalence between RTL and software netlist 
based on the properties to be verified.  We describe this next.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RESTRICTED CYCLE ACCURATE EQUIVALENCE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\para{Property-based Observable Equivalence}
%
Recall that a software netlist is derived from a hardware RTL for the
purposes of formal verification.  To this end, the formal specification or 
properties (temporal or non-temporal) over RTL signals that captures hardware behaviors 
are translated into assertions over the corresponding software variables in 
software netlist and checked for consistency against the software
netlist model.  Thus, our notion of equivalence is based on the signals 
that are observable in the properties under consideration.  We call this equivalence criteria 
\emph{property-based observable equivalence}.  
Intuitively, this means that the state of latches and wires 
present in the property must match with the corresponding variables in software 
netlist model at some designated clock cycle.  The effect of a clock cycle 
in the software netlist model is simulated through an invocation of the top 
level procedure which corresponds to the top level module of the RTL~\cite{mtk2016}.  
The proposed notion of equivalence is sufficient for the purposes of property-based 
verification.
\Omit{Note that a software netlist is synthesized from a hardware
RTL for the purposes of formal verification, just like a bit-level netlist or
word-level netlist are synthesized from an RTL. So, the proposed consistency 
criteria is sufficient for this purpose.}  
Techniques such as translation validation~\cite{mtk2016} that check the 
consistency between a RTL and a software is a different problem and beyond 
the scope of this work.

\begin{definition} (Property-based Observable Equivalent) 
  Two designs $C_1$ and $C_2$ are \emph{property-based observable equivalent} with
  respect to a property $P$ if the following conditions holds true. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For a non-temporal property $P$, the result of analysis of $P$ must
      match in $C1$ and $C2$ at every clock cycle.  
   \item For a temporal property $P$, the result of analysis of $P$ must 
     match in $C_1$ and $C_2$ at some \emph{designated} clock cycle.  Such
      designated clock cycle are determined from the temporal operator used in $P$. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
%
Two designs $C_1$ and $C_2$ are \emph{not} property-based observable equivalent 
with respect to a non-temporal property $P$ if there exists a clock cycle where 
the result of analysis of $P$ does not match.  Intuitively, this means that 
there exists some latches or wires and a cycle $N$ where the observable signals in $P$ 
does not match in $C_1$ and $C_2$, resulting in inconsistent result of anaysis of $P$. 
%
Whereas, two designs $C_1$ and $C_2$ are \emph{not} property-based observable equivalent 
with respect to a temporal property $P$ if there exists a \emph{designated} clock cycle 
where the result of analysis of $P$ does not match. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example}
%
Figure~\ref{figure:equivalence} gives an example of a Verilog RTL (in left) and 
the corresponding software netlist in C (in right) that are 
property-based observable equivalent with respect to a temporal 
property (marked in red).  The property of Verilog 
is specified in SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA)~\cite{SVA} language.  
The equivalent assertion in software netlist is shown in the right (marked in red).  


We explain the condition for which the models are equivalent 
with respect to the SVA assertion using a waveform in figure~\ref{fig:waveform}.  
Suppose $in=1$ at clock cycle $i$. 
Then, the state of the latch $out3$ is not consistent in 
Verilog and C at cycle $i$.  This is due to the fact that 
the value of $out3$ \emph{stabilizes} one cycle after the 
input $in=1$ was set, that is, $out3$ is stabilized in cycle $i+1$.  
This behavior is formally captured 
in SVA using the constraint \texttt{(in==1 |-> \#\#1 out3)}.  The SVA 
specifies that latch $out3$ is high exactly one cycle after $in$ was high.  
Both the models are \emph{safe} in this case, that is, the property 
holds true in both models.  The property is proven equivalent for 
unbounded cycles using a hardware model checker and a software verifier.  
%Thus, a software netlist must be cycle-accurate-property-equivalent to a
%hardware RTL for the purposes of formal verification. 
\end{example}
%


%Thus, the example in Figure~\ref{figure:prop1} demonstrate that the designs 
%are cycle-accurate-property-equivalent but not cycle-accurate-equivalent.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LTL Semantics to C %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\para{Properties}
%
In this paper, we used System Verilog Assertions to express properties about 
the RTL design that we are interested to verify.  The SVA properties are translated 
into an intemediate Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)~\cite{} representation.  
LTL is a modal logic that is commonly used to reason about a hardware 
transition system.  The modalities in LTL refers to
temporal operators like $G$ (global), $F$ (eventaul), $X$ (next) and $U$
(until).  An LTL formula may contain propositional symbols, boolean or temporal
operators.  We skip the details of LTL since this is standard. 


The translation of LTL to a \emph{Buchi Automaton}
(BA) is an well-known technique~\cite{Gastin:2001, SomenziB00} and has been
sucessfully used for LTL model checking such as Spin model checker~\cite{spin}.   
Further, a buchi automaton can be modeled using a C program that simply encodes
the state transition relation of BA.  Figure~\ref{prop} gives an example of LTL
and the corresponding assertion in $\mathcal{SN}$.  Note that the next operator
(X) in LTL is modeled by invoking the top level procedure
$M(clk,in1,in2,out1,out2,out3)$ in $\mathcal{SN}$ which also 
corresponds to the top level module of the hardware circuit.

The goal of this translation is to perform formal property verification 
of the software netlist model $\mathcal{SN}$ against the assertions given 
in SVA.
%expressed over the variables of $\mathcal{SN}$.  
%
While we do not have a formal proof of correctness, experiments have shown that for 
property verification, valid safety properties are proven to be $k$-inductive for 
the same unwind depth $k$ in the RTL and software netlist models.  Conversely, 
for unsafe designs, a bug is found for the same unwind depth in both the models.
