A survey of bounded and unbounded SAT-based hardware model checking techniques 
is presented in~\cite{charme05}.
Table~\ref{timeline} provides a summary of technology transfer between the 
hardware verification community and software verification community over the past 
two decades.  The table provides the reference to the very first technique proposed 
in the literature in either community but there are subsequent works that
follows up from these.  For example, techniques like predicate abstraction, 
IC3 or Property Directed Reachability (PDR), $k$-induction, and 
interpolation-based approaches have all made their way from the hardware 
to the software domain; but path-wise symbolic execution and abstract 
interpretation have been primarily used for software verification.
