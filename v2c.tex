\section{Translating RTL to Software Netlists}\label{sec:v2c}

The main challenges in translating Verilog faithfully into C are presented by its hardware-oriented elements. Many Verilog statements have no direct analogue in C.  Some examples are
initial blocks, always blocks, generate statements, and procedural assignments
(blocking and non-blocking). Verilog also has hardware-oriented operators such as part-select, bit-select from vectors, concatenation, and reduction. Finally, Verilog supports the 4-valued data types
reg, wire, and integer. Moreover, all these are combined with parallelism.

In view of this complexity, our translation is deliberately direct and transparent: we aim to
preserve the RTL's structure and refrain from optimization and abstraction. Fidelity of the
resulting C to the semantics of the Verilog is prioritised, and we rely on
downstream software analysis tools for efficiency.

Our translation is implemented in a tool called V2C~\cite{mtk2016}. The front-end performs Verilog parsing, macro preprocessing, and type-checking. The result is a type-annotated parse-tree, which is then translated into C. There are two main aspects to the translation. The first deals largely with the representation in C of Verilog data values---for example Verilog data types, wires and registers, and Verilog expressions with bit-manipulating operations. This is explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:data}. The second is the scheduling of non-blocking and blocking assignments in Verlog code into a suitable C sequentialization, depending on the their syntactic context, which is explained in Section~\ref{seq}. Inter-modular dependencies between the always clocked blocks and the continuous assignment statements are resolved by a dependency analysis. The detail of this part are explained in Section~\ref{sec:dep}.

Translation is followed by code-generation, in which the intermediate expressions and translated module items are converted to ANSI-C program syntax.

\label{figure:bit}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Verilog Data, Expressions, and Circuit Structures}\label{sec:data}

The first elements of our translation deal with data and hardware-oriented structural desciption.

\subsubsection{Data Model} The data model in Verilog is significantly 
different from C. Single-bit Verilog data comprises four values: $0$, $1$, $\const{X}$, and $\const{Z}$.  The values 0
and 1 represents low and high voltage---logical false and true.
The further values $X$ and $\const{Z}$ represent an unknown 
and an electrical high impedance state, respectively.  The 
simplest synthesis semantics for $\const{X}$ is to treate it 
as a don't-care; this allows synthesis to improve logic minimization.  
But V2C translates $\const{X}$ to a non-deterministic Boolean value in C.
The uncommon value $\const{Z}$ is rarely used in real Verilog circuits aimed for syntheis and hence it is outside the scope of our translation.

\subsubsection{Bit-Manipulating Operations}
V2C translates complex bit-manipulating Verilog operators, such as 
bit-select and part-select from a vector,
concatenation, reduction OR, to semantically equivalent expressions in ANSI-C. The translation retains 
the word-level structure of the Verilog RTL.  Fig.~\ref{figure:bit} shows 
some code snippets of typical bit-manipulating operations in 
Verilog RTL in top row and the corresponding ANSI-C operations is shown in bottom row.

\subsubsection{Variable declaration} Verilog variables of specific 
bit-width (register, wire) are translated 
to the next largest native data-types in C---such as  char, short int, long, and long long. The default 
variable declaration in C is \texttt{unsigned}, except for 
the \texttt{integer} declaration in Verilog, which is signed.

\subsubsection{Registers, wires, parameters and constants} Verilog supports structural 
data types called \emph{nets}, which comprise \emph{wire}
and \emph{reg}. The value of a wire variable changes 
continuously as the input value changes.  Variables of
\emph{reg} type hold their values until another is 
assigned to them.  In the translation, a C structure containing all state-holding
elements is declared to store the register values. Wires are represented in C by local variables.  
Verilog parameters are constants that are
typically used to specify the width of bit-vector variables.
Such parameters are declared as constants in C.  
Verilog also allows the definition of the global constants 
using \texttt{define} construct; these translate to \texttt{\#define}
preprocessor directives in C.

\subsubsection{Module Hierarchy with Input/Output Port}
Communication between Verilog modules takes place through 
ports, which are signals listed among the parameters at the 
top of the module. Ports can be of type \texttt{in}, \texttt{out}, and \texttt{inout}. 
Fig.~\ref{figure:module-hierarchy} shows an example of 
the translation of a Verilog module hierarchy to C.
The output ports are passed as references 
to propogate changes back to the parent module.
The generated C code preserves the module hierarchy of 
the RTL.

\subsection{Assignment Sequentialization}~\label{seq}

\subsubsection{Procedural Assignments}
%
Procedural assignments are used within Verilog 
procedures like always and initial blocks and are of 
two types: \emph{blocking} and \emph{non-blocking}.  
Blocking statements are executed in sequential order. However, blocking
assignments which are triggered from the same event execute
in parallel.  We model the parallelism using an auxiliary variable
for all the blocking assignments that are sensitive to the same event. 
On the other hand, the non-blocking statements always 
execute in parallel for the same clock. To model 
parallelism for non-blocking statements, we 
use shadow-variable based update technique. 
The value of register variables are stored in 
auxiliary variables in the beginning of the clock cycle.  
Each read access to the register variables is then replaced 
by these auxiliary variables. This ensures that 
an assignment to the register variable do not influence the 
subsequent assignments. Figure~\ref{figure:block} shows 
the translation of procedural assignments (shown in top) to 
the equivalent C semantics (shown in bottom).

\label{figure:block}

%
\subsubsection{Continuous Assignment}
%
The continuous assignment is used to assign a value onto a 
wire in a module. Continuous assignments are concurrent statements 
which are immediately triggered when there is any change 
in the right-hand side inputs. The translation of continuous 
assignments are discussed next. 


\subsubsection{Always and Initial blocks}
Always blocks are the concurrent statements which execute when a 
variable in the sensitivity list changes. The statements enclosed inside the 
always block within $begin \ldots end$ construct are executed in parallel
or sequentially depending on whether it is non-blocking or blocking statement 
respectively.   The behavior of an initial block is same as the always blocks, 
except that they are executed exactly once, before the execution of any 
always block. Figure~\ref{figure:always-init} shows the translation of always
and initial block (shown in top) to C (shown in bottom). All code-snippets are
partial and complete C code could not be accommodated due to space limit.

\subsection{Dependency Analysis}~\label{sec:dep}

%
A hardware circuit specified in Verilog RTL may have two types of dependencies -- 
1) \emph{Intra-modular dependency} and b) \emph{Inter-modular dependency}. 
%
\subsubsection{Intra-Modular Dependency Analysis}
%
The intra-modular dependencies may occur due to the communication between
combinational blocks (continuous assignments) and sequential or clocked 
procedural blocks.  We illustrate three different scenarios that summarize 
the various sources of intra-modular dependencies in Verilog and show 
how these dependencies are handled in a software netlist.  Other forms of 
intra-modular dependencies are simply variants of these three cases 
and can be handled appropriately.
%
Figure~\ref{dp1}--~\ref{dp3} graphically illustrate the intra-modular dependencies.  
%
Here, box denote an input, a bold circle denote a wire and a normal circle
denote a latch.  The bold edges denote the dependencies between two wires or a latch 
and a wire with the arrow pointing towards the wire and normal edges denote the 
dependencies between two latches or a wire and a latch with the arrow pointing
towards the latch. The dotted arrows denote the dependencies with an input. 
%
We describe the various scenarios and the corresponding translations below. 
Note that the code-snippets in Figure~\ref{dp1}--~\ref{dp3} are partial 
and are only used for illustrating the handling of intra-modular dependencies.
\\
%
\noindent \textbf{Scenario A}  A wire, say $x$,  assigned in a continuous assignment 
statement, say $A$, appears in the right-hand side of another continuous assignment 
statement, say $B$.  This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{dp1}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Translation A} The variable assignment $A$ is placed before the other assignment $B$ 
which reads $x$.  \\

\noindent \textbf{Scenario B} A wire, say $x$, appearing in the right-hand side of a 
continuous assignment, say $A$, is driven by an always block.  This is illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{dp2}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Translation B} This gives an ordering where the continuous assignment is 
placed after the always block to capture the updated value of $x$. \\

\noindent \textbf{Scenario C} A latch, say $x$, appearing in procedural block, 
say $A$, is assigned directly by the input signal and $x$ is then read inside 
another procedural block. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{dp3}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Translation C} The assignment to $x$ is placed before the second 
procedural block that reads $x$.\\

\Omit{For designs with inter-modular combinational paths or combinational loops,
the combinational signals (wire variables) may settle after several
executions before the next clock cycle.  The combinational exchanges between
modules depends on the stability condition for the combinational signals and
thus it is necessary to execute the combinational logic until the stability
condition is reached.  Determining such stability condition for large
circuits is hard.  An alternative way to handle combinational exchanges
between modules is by using assumptions over the signals that encode
combinational logic in the respective modules following synthesis semantics. 
An example using the latter approach is given at
\url{http://www.cprover.org/hardware/v2c/}.
}
%
\subsubsection{Inter-Modular Dependency Analysis}
%
Modules in Verilog communicate with each other through their input or output
ports. Most practical designs are modular in nature, where the top-level 
module delegates specific tasks to the sub-modules.
%through the input ports of sub-module and receive output from 
%the sub-module upon completion of the task.  
Modules and sub-modules executes \emph{in-tandem}, that is, a
module is \emph{not} blocked when it invokes a sub-module. 


An example of inter-modular communication can be illustrated
using the design in figure~\ref{figure:equivalence}.  The top-level 
module \texttt{main} invokes the submodule \texttt{M}.  
The equivalent translation in C (shown in right of figure~\ref{figure:equivalence}) 
preserves the modular structure. 
%
Another example of inter-modular communication is a \emph{combinational feedback loop} 
where participating modules exchange combinational data until a stability condition is reached.  
%
Determining this kind of stability condition completely automatically 
is difficult for large circuits.  Hence, manual translation is performed in such cases.
%  
\subsection{Limitations of V2C Translator}~\label{v2clim}
%  
V2C does not support automatic translation of RTL designs that contain 
the following design features -- a) Multi-clock designs,
b) Transparent latches, 
c) Combinational feedback loop, and d) Circular module dependency. 
%  
%
In this paper, we present an automatic translation and verification 
of the RTL designs that do not contain the above design features.   
%  
We now briefly demonstrate the complexity of manually translating 
a design that contains combinational feedback loop.  
Figure~\ref{figure:comb-loop} gives a Verilog design with 
combinational feedback loop on the left.  The right side of 
Figure~\ref{figure:comb-loop} gives the equivalent software netlist, 
which is translated manually. 
%  
The Verilog module {\em foo} is partitioned into two separate modules during
translation -- a combinational module, {\em foo\_comb} and a sequential module,
{\em foo\_seq}.  The combinational exchanges between the Verilog modules {\em top}
and {\em foo} continues until the values of a and z becomes stable, which in 
this case is equal to the width of these registers (32-bit).  This stability 
condition is manually identified and modeled in the software netlist design 
by invoking the procedure {\em foo\_comb} from the {\em main} routine
32 times, followed by a call to the sequential module {\em foo\_seq} which simply
updates the register $y$.  
%  
Note that the assertion given by $(y==loopback)$ in Figure~\ref{figure:comb-loop} 
holds true in the RTL as well as the software netlist design, which is established 
using off-the-shelf hardware and software model checkers respectively.
